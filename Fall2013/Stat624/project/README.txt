You clearly had a difficult distribution and put a lot of effort into this project.  Your code is very good.  The problem is that you didn't leave enough time to polish the oral presentation and written report.  They don't reflect the effort that you put into the project and the quality of the code.  I hope is was a good learning experience because you have a lot of potential!  85/100
