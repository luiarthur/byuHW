Homework 5
Name: Arthur Lui
Grade: 92.5

1. Mann Whiteny Monte Carlo p-values --you changed the function call slightly... but the arguments work the same, so I guess that's okay.
-called "mann-whitney.R"
-function call is "mann.whitney <- function(sample1,sample2,alternative="greater")"
-returns {test stat, montecarlo pvalue, lower and upper bounds of 95% }

2. Monte Carlo Power calculations --Power calculations appear to be off: I think you used "rr" when you meant to use "rr[1]" (-3pts)
-if alpha is .05, what is the rejection region? --reject for values greater than highest observed? (-1/2 pt)
-If the true proportion of black balls is .6, what is the power of the test for the null hypotheiss that hte porportion of black balls is .5, vs. prop >.5
-What is the power if the true porportion is .7 
-all with Monte Carlo error

3. Advanced Graphic --extra comma in sumPrec[,2] (-1pt). Didn't call function (-2pts)
-Provo weather data. 
-Kinda like NYT's plot
-looks good

Contains only "mann-whitney.R", "urn.R", and "nytimes.R" files (and any data files that your script needs to read!) --plot not called weather.pdf (-1pt)
