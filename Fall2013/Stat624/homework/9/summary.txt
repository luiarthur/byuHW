I will refer to the following abbreviations:

(1) The Maximum Likelihood Estimator as MLE.

(2) The Bayes Estimator under squared-error loss where the prior distribution 
on beta is a normal distribution with mean 0.4 and standard deviation of 0.5 
as BE1.

(3) The Bayes Estimator under 0-1 loss where the prior distribution on beta is 
uniform on -2 to 2 as BE2.


Summary: 

The biases for all three estimators seem to be close to 0, but mostly negative. 
The biases across different values of beta ranges from -.04 to .01.
The biases for the MLE and the BE2 start negative but move towards 0 as beta
increases.

The MSE's for all three estimators appear to behave similarly. 
They decrease as the value of the true beta increases.

As the MSE's are all decreasing and appear to converge towards one another,
the MLE and BE2 appear to be the better estimates as they move towards 0 as the
value of the true beta increases.
