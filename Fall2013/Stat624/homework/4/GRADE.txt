-Only summary.tex and slope.R

CODE: --Good
-didn't edit skeleton
-different error terms
-returns point estimates and CI's

WRITEUP:
Under what error terms is the estimator of the slope biased? --but 0 is in the confidence intervall...? should be the correlated errors that are biased (-3pts)
Does the confidence interval estimator have the right coverage under the normally distributed error terms? 
How about under the chi-squared distributed error terms? 
How about under the correlated error terms? 
If the error terms in which the coverage is not correct, under what situation is it noticeable? 
When, if ever, does this coverage problem go away?
What phenomenon makes it go away? --Assuming this is included in your statement "Monte Carlo error goes/tends to 0"
