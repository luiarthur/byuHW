\subsection*{Q: Under what error terms is the estimator of the slope biased?}

When the error terms are standard normal, the slope is biased. That is, the $1 - \alpha_2/2$ confidence interval for the bias does not contain 0.

\subsection*{Q: Does the confidence interval estimator have the right coverage under the normally distributed error terms?}
Yes, because the $1 - \alpha_2/2$  confidence interval contains $\alpha_1$. 


\subsection*{Q: How about under the chi-squared distributed error terms?}
No, because the $1 - \alpha_2/2$  confidence interval does not contain $\alpha_1$. 

\subsection*{Q: How about the correlated error terms?}
No, because the $1 - \alpha_2/2$  confidence interval does not contain $\alpha_1$. 

\subsection*{Q: Under what situations is an incorrect coverage more noticable?}
When nreps is large, an incorrect coverage is more noticable.

\subsection*{Q: When does the problem go away?}
When nreps tends to infinity, the problem goes away because Monte Carlo error goes tends to 0 as nreps tends to infinity.
