- The hardest thing you did in VBA/Excel
    (~ Financial)
  - present the problem
  - how you solved the problem (30-60sec)
    
    OPTION I:
    For my final project in my VBA class, I had the freedom to choose what I wanted to do.
    I chose to write a program to simulate exam FM problems, as I was preparing to take FM. 

    I made use of user forms with options tab, and tried to make it look like the real exam. 
    I chose the problems from FM practice exams that I thought were most challenging for me. 
    I had about 30 questions. And for each problem, I generated new numbers and computed the
    answers in VBA. I would then have to answer my own questions.
  
  
    OPTION II:
    For the final exam. I was given a list of product ID's for different cereals and was asked
    to find the cost, brand, size, and weight about the cereals. I had to retrieve that information
    from a website and populate a spreadsheet with the information.
    Since I had to lookup over 100 cereals, we had to use VBA to automate the data retrieving
    process.
    With the help of a package to obtain the HTML files of a website, I concatenated the data website
    with the product ID and obtained the HTML files, then used regular expressions to find the data.
    Then, I put the information into the correct cells.

    
    OPTION III:
    Knapsack problem. Given a knapsack of a limited capacity. And items with different values and
    weights. Pack the knapsack with the items to maximize the value of the items in the knapsack.
    The problem is quite trivial if you can break items into pieces, because you just keep packing
    your knapsack with items that have highest value/weight ratio, until you are about to exceed
    the knapsack's capacity, then you pack on a portion of the next most valuable item. 
    If, however, you can only take parts of an item, you have to implement a dynamic programming
    algorithm. I prototyped the solution in VBA, then coded the solution in C++ (for speed).

      - What I can do:
          Optimization, Ribbons, Internet, regular expressions, user forms

  

- Tell me about a time you worked in a team (one example, short)
  - balance between academic and non-academic (mission, companion, jazz, conflicts)

    This semester, I am in a jazz combo, where I play the piano. I used to be a piano performance
    major, but I had not played jazz until 2 years ago. So I felt like a newb.

    Working in a team in this kind of setting was really hard for me at first, because it's hard  
    I don't know very much of the jazz vocabulary, but I do feel that sometimes I have better ideas




- Tell me about a time you were a leader (45-60 sec)

- What do you do in your free time? (Piano)
- Most valuable work experience?
  Right now, I am a research Assistant for a professor in the Stats department. I am learning about MC 
  sampling methods for DP mixture models. 


- Favorite subject / class taken

- Why Pacific Life? 

- Tell me about a time you went above and beyond?

- A weakness?

- Do you prefer to work in a team or by yourself?
