\section{Assessing Multivariate Normality}
  When individual columns of data are not univariate or bivariate normal, we can
  conclude that the data are not multivariate normal. The converse, however, is
  not true. The data do not appear normal from the univariate plots of their
  histograms. But, the transformed data appear to be approximately univariate
  and bivariate normal, with the exception of some outliers. Therefore, to
  conclude whether the data are multivariate normal, we must do some other
  formal test. Here, we choose to calculate skewness and kurtosis to help us
  determine whether the data are multivariate normal.
  % What are the outliers? Can I put a plot here / refer to a plot here?
