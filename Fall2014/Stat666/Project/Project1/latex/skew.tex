  \subsection{Skewness \& Kurtosis}
    One way to determine whether data are multivariate normal is to calculate
    the skewness and kurtosis of the data. We estimate skewness and kurtosis
    with:

    \[
        \begin{array}{rcl}
          b_{1,p} &=& \frac{1}{n^2} 
                      \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\sum\limits_{j=1}^n {g_{ij}}^3 \\
          b_{2,p} &=& \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n {g_{ii}}^2\\
        \end{array}
    \]
    
    \noindent
    where $n$ is the number of observations, $b_{1,p}$ is the skewness,
    $b_{2,p}$ is the kurtosis, and 
    
    \[
      g_{ij} = (\bm y_i-\bm{\bar y})^\prime \bm\Sigma^{-1}(\bm y_j-\bm{\bar y}).
    \]
    
    The skewness for the transformed data is $31.75$, and the kurtosis is
    $122.37$. This appears large. We expect the skewness and kurtosis for
    multivariate data to be, respectively, $0$ and $p(p+2)=80$, where $p=$ the
    number of covariates (8). To determine whether the skewness and kurtosis are
    significantly greater than 0 and 80, respectively, we calculate the statistics:

    \[
      \begin{array}{rcl}
        z_1 &=& \frac{\ds(p+1)(n+1)(n+3)}{\ds6[(n+1)(p+1)-6]}b_{1,p}\\
        &&\\
        z_2 &=& \frac{\ds b_{2,p}-p(p+2)/n}
                     {\ds \sqrt{8p(p+2)/n}} \\
        &&\\
        %z_3 &=& \frac{\ds b_{2,p}-p(p+2)(n+p+1)/n}
        %             {\ds \sqrt{8p(p+2)/(n-1)}} \\
        %&&\\
      \end{array}
    \]

    We calculated $z_1 = 287.54$. $z_1$ follows a $\chi^2$ distribution with
    degrees of freedom $\frac{1}{6}p(p+1)(p+2)$. So, the p-value associated
    with the statistic $z_1$ is $8.88 \times 10^{-16}$. $z_2=3.36$ and follows
    a Normal(0,1) distribution. Since, the pvalue associated with a z-score of
    3.36 is .000396 (<.05).  So we reject the hypothesis that the skewness is
    0, and we reject the null hypothesis that the kurtosis is 80, and conclude
    that the skewness is significantly different from 0.  Therefore, the
    transformed data, with outliers removed, are \emph{not multivariate
    normal}.
