Cars Data Set Conceptualization Sheet

Goals:
  Car dealers want to make a profit by selling used cars but in order 
  to ensure that they can sell the car for more than they paid for it, 
  they need to predict the future selling price at the time of trade-in.
  That is, when they receive the car from a trade-in, they need to know
  what they can eventually sell the car traded in for, so that they 
  can "puchase" it for less than the price they will sell the used car
  for.

  Many factors affect the value of the car - color, mileage, number of doors, etc.

Key Features:
  More Categorical data that quantitative data

Potential Model:
  Linear Model
  Y = Price
  X = Everything Else
