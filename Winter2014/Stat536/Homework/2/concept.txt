Conceptualization Sheet 2 (GDP)

Notes:
Growth in GDP <=> Low Unemployment Rate, Increasing Wages (because more spending)
Decline in GDP <=> High Unemployment Rate, lower profits (less spending)

* Declining GDP is a worry to Economists because associated with recession.


Goals:
  Understand the driving forces behind GDP. 
  That is understand what variables contribute to a rise (or decline) in GDP.

Key Features of Statistical Analysis:
  Collinearity
  Many variables
  More variables than observations (60 countries, 70 variables)

Potential Model:
  Maybe use some kind of clustering algorithm to cluster countries 
  that have high GDP.
  Have a feature matrix that indicates what "features" each countries have.
  Then figure out what features contribute to high GDP?

One Feature I don't know How to Do:
  I really don't know where to start. 
  I want to know how to get started when looking at this data set.
  Should I use MLR?
  Is this going to be a clustering problem?
