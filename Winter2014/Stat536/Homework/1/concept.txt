Goals of case study:
  Predict the balance of card holders BEFORE issuing card.
  Determine characteristics of a card holder that lead to high balances. 

  Want: Moderate Balance 
  Avoid: High Balance 
  Don't Care about: Low Balance

Key Features of Statistical Analysis:
  Multiple Linear Regression with Qualitative and Quantitative Variables
  
  In R, pairs(credit) reveals that some of the covariates have linear
  relationships. So, we may have to adjust our model to account for
  collinearity.

  Response: 
    Balance (quantitative)
  Input:
    Quantitative: | Qualitative:
      Income      |   Cards
      Limit       |   Gender
      Rating      |   Student

                  |   Ethnicity

  (i.e. group card holders with 7 or more cards together into one group: 7+)

Potential Model:
  Linear Model
