        \frametitle{Model}
        Random Forest - The idea is to create a multitude of trees (forest)
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item Take a bootstrap sample of size $n$.
        \item At each split, randomly sample $m<P$ variables
        \item Build a tree based on each set
          \begin{enumerate}
          \item At each node, identify variable that has most correlation with output
          \item Identify a cut point that leads to the greatest reduction in error
          \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
      }

      \frame{
        \frametitle{Random Forests}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item[+] Better predictive power than trees
          \begin{itemize}
          \item Choosing a subset of variables decorrelates the trees
          \end{itemize}
        \item[+] Gives us an objective way of classifying tornados
        \item[-] However, random forests are not very interpretable
        \end{itemize}
      }

      \frame{
        \frametitle{Model Assumptions}
          For classification trees, we assume data is non-linear

%       - Show your results? (But how?)
%       - How would a scientist use our model? (Using predictors and find Prediction)
%       - Plot while holding other variables constant, and changing Loss,
