Due February 7

Part I

Data contained in the file “nursing .csv” were obtained from 927
first born children whose mothers chose to breastfeed. Of interest is 
whether any characteristic (or combination of characteristics) of the mother 
was predictive of how long the mother chose to nurse (i.e., how long before 
weaning). For this data set, duration is measured in WEEKS. The variable 
“completion” indicates whether the baby was weaned (1=yes, 0=no) at the 
reported duration.

Covariates include:

  race:       1=white, 2=black, 3=other
  poverty:    1=mother in poverty, 0=otherwise
  smoking:    1=mother smoking around the time of birth, 0=otherwise
  alcohol:    1=mother usin galcohol around the time of birth, 0=otherwise
  age:        age of mother at time of child’s birth
  education:  education of mother (in years)
  prenatal:   0=mother sought prenatal care in first three months of pregnancy, 
              1=otherwise


Conduct an analysis of this data using the Cox proportional hazards model.
Such an analysis will include identification of covariates significantly 
associated with breastfeeding duration (hints: check effect of interactions, 
grouping (e.g. dichotomize) covariates where appropriate), interpretation 
of resultant model parameters, comparison of subgroups, and numerical and 
graphical presentation of results.


As with other assignments, a final write up should be provided and should be in
either pdf or Word format. The write up should include both a brief introduction
(describing the data and objectives of interest) and a summary. The summary
should consist of a discussion of the results.


Code utilized for the analyses should be included as a separate file.




Part II
Using the final model selected in Part I, conduct the same analysis in SAS. Ensure
that results are equivalent. Provide the model output and SAS code used to generate
the model. No write up is required.
