Model Assessment:
  - Residuals
  - Graphical (qq plot, residual plots)

Model Validation:
  - Predicted vs. Actual value
  - test and train sets (cross validation)
  - cant use MSE, so use what?
  
  For MLR:
    - MSE is easy to compute For Cox Models:
    - exp(X'b) = hazard ratio = risk score
    - high values of b => increased risk 
      1) Obtain a model using training data 
      2) Obtain risk scores using model coef and 
         test data 
      3) Dichotomize risk score:
         - obtain high/low risk groups
         - i.e., obtain a prediction
         - look at KM curves and logrank test to
           compare two risk groups
      4) Assess whether predicted high/low risk 
         groups correspond with reality.
         (Check whether there is a significant 
         different b/w predicted high/low risk
         groups).
